# Lab 6 Reflection

## Function Organization

Describe how you organized your code using functions (use a markdown list for this answer):

- **show_sequence() function:** How did this function display LED patterns for memorization?
- **get_button_press() function:** How did this function handle timing-based button input?
- **test_memory() function:** How did this function coordinate LED display with button timing?
- **calculate_score() function:** How did this function determine points based on performance?
- **show_feedback() function:** How did this function provide visual success/failure patterns?
- **wait_for_button() function:** How did this function manage game progression?
- **main() function:** How did this function coordinate the overall game flow?
